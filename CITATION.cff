abstract: "HPFRACC is a high-performance Python library for fractional calculus operations with neural network integration. It provides implementations of fractional derivatives (Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov), fractional integrals, special functions, and advanced machine learning capabilities including neural fractional ODEs and SDEs, graph neural networks, and intelligent backend selection for optimal performance."
