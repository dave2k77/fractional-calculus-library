# 1) What the results really say

-   **Gradient norm ↓ 2×** with identical forward error (0.99–1.00 ratio) is exactly what we want from a correct adjoint: same operator, cleaner optimisation landscape. Expect fewer exploding steps and less LR fiddling.
-   **5.7× average speed-up** with scaling improving at larger $N$ is classic FFT behaviour (compute bound overtakes Python overhead). This will compound in PDE loops (many operator applications per step).
-   **Adjoint identity to $10^{-6}$** and *real-in/real-out* confirm you’ve fixed branch/phase issues and chosen a self-adjoint symbol (Riesz) or consistently applied conjugation (Weyl). Good.
-   **Learnable $\alpha$** working end-to-end is non-trivial; that unlocks variable physics discovery and data-driven regularisation.

# 2) Remaining risks (and how to test them fast)

1.  **Limits $\alpha\to 0$ and $\alpha\to 2$.**
     The operator should approach identity and (minus) the Laplacian, respectively. Add limit tests:
     $\|D^{\alpha\to 0}f-f\| \to 0$ and $\|D^{\alpha\to 2}f - (-\Delta)f\|\to 0$ for smooth periodic $f$.
2.  **Semigroup check.**
     For the Riesz family: $D^\alpha D^\beta f = D^{\alpha+\beta} f$ (symbol $|\xi|^{\alpha+\beta}$). Numerical test with random $f$ should pass to 1e-6–1e-7 on well-resolved grids.
3.  **Aliasing under nonlinearity.**
     Your operator is linear, but the *models* won’t be. Verify the **3/2 de-aliasing rule** (pad to 1.5×, apply, truncate) vs. no padding inside a nonlinear block; check stability and spectrum contamination.
4.  **Low-frequency (& DC) handling.**
     Ensure the zero mode is handled deterministically: $0^\alpha=0$ for $\alpha>0$. Add a unit test that perturbs the mean and confirms predictable behaviour.
5.  **Mixed precision & tiny logs.**
     With learnable $\alpha$, you multiply by $\log|\omega|$. Guard with `clamp_min(tiny)`; check BF16/FP16 don’t NaN on zero bins. Add AMP tests.
6.  **Boundary assumptions.**
     Current spectral path is *periodic*. If training on non-periodic signals, add a test suite with windowing/padding or even/odd extensions and compare against a time-domain GL/Caputo reference on short intervals.
7.  **Large-D tensors.**
     Extend the tests to 2D/3D (rfftn/irfftn) and anisotropic variants. Speed-ups and cache behaviour can change; validate memory footprint and correctness.
8.  **Heavy-tailed / rough inputs.**
     For $\alpha>1$ the operator amplifies high frequencies hard. Run Monte-Carlo on α-stable noise and rough signals; assert finite-variance outputs and stable gradients with a small spectral taper.

# 3) Concrete upgrades (do these next)

## A. Make the implementation production-grade

-   **rFFT everywhere for real signals.** Halves memory and guarantees Hermitian symmetry.

-   **Plan caching / kernel caching.** Cache `ω` grids and kernels per `(N, dx, device, dtype, α)`; for learnable $\alpha$, cache `|ω|` and reuse across steps.

-   **Robust $\partial/\partial \alpha$.** Use `log(|ω|.clamp_min(tiny))`. For $\alpha$ optimisation, parameterise with a bounded transform:

    α(ρ)=αmin⁡+(αmax⁡−αmin⁡) sigmoid(ρ),\alpha(\rho)=\alpha_{\min} + (\alpha_{\max}-\alpha_{\min}) \,\mathrm{sigmoid}(\rho),

    to avoid drifting into ill-posed orders during early training.

-   **Axes & ND generality.** Support arbitrary `axes` and broadcast kernels; expose an `ndim`-agnostic API.

-   **autograd/vjp clarity.** In PyTorch, keep a single `torch.autograd.Function` with explicit `ctx.save_for_backward(Xhat_or_x, omega)` so `grad_α` is cheap. In JAX, use `custom_vjp` with a single vjp definition (no duplicated logic).

## B. Boundary & non-periodic data support

-   **Even/odd extension helpers.** Provide `extend_periodic(x, mode="even"/"odd", pad=K)` to map Dirichlet/Neumann problems into periodic space.
-   **Windowing presets.** Offer Dolph–Chebyshev and Tukey windows to suppress wrap-around, with automated bandwidth compensation (so amplitude isn’t biased).
-   **Toeplitz (GL) reference.** Include a simple GL/Caputo CPU reference for short signals to validate boundary-sensitive cases in CI.

## C. Tempered and directional variants

-   **Tempered Riesz.** Add symbol $(\lambda^2+|\xi|^2)^{\alpha/2}-\lambda^\alpha$. This controls long-range tails (useful on finite data) and is often better behaved for learning.
-   **Directional fractional derivatives.** Expose $D^\alpha_{\mathbf v}$ with symbol $|\mathbf v\!\cdot\!\xi|^\alpha$. Handy for anisotropic diffusion and texture models.
-   **Space–time split.** Keep the spatial operator spectral (Riesz), and add a **Caputo-in-time** block (GL convolution) with a memory-efficient “short-memory” option.

## D. Mellin/log-FFT path (when scale matters)

-   **FFTLog backbone.** Implement a log-grid $x_n=x_0 e^{n\Delta}$ and do FFT in $\log x$. The Mellin multiplier $\Gamma(s)/\Gamma(s-\alpha)$ then acts diagonally; fractional shifts become phase ramps.
-   **Use cases.** Power-laws $x^\beta$, multiplicative scalings, or when the input spans many decades (e.g., spectra). Bench vs. Fourier on those.

## E. Operator-learning & PDE integrations

-   **Fractional heat stepper.** For $u_t=-c(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u$, provide the *exact spectral* update
     $\hat u_{t+\Delta t} = \exp(-c\,|\xi|^\alpha\,\Delta t)\,\hat u_t$. This is a perfect demo that your operator preserves energy decay.
-   **PINN/fPINO blocks.** Wrap $D^\alpha$ as a layer with trainable $\alpha$ and optional tempering $\lambda$. Expose Jacobians so physics losses can probe $\partial u/\partial \alpha$ cleanly.
-   **Identifiability checks.** Synthetic inverse problems where $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are both learnable; verify that $\alpha$ isn’t absorbed by network scaling.

## F. Benchmarks & CI you should lock in

-   **Red-team tests.** (i) adjoint to $10^{-7}$; (ii) semigroup; (iii) $\alpha\to\{0,2\}$ limits; (iv) DC mode; (v) AMP BF16; (vi) aliasing under $\tanh$ nonlinearity.
-   **Complex-step derivative** for $\partial L/\partial\alpha$ to validate your analytic gradient (no finite-difference noise).
-   **Property-based testing** (Hypothesis) on random shapes/axes/dtypes/devices.
-   **Performance CI.** Microbench across sizes $\{32,\dots,4096\}$ and dtypes, fail PRs that regress by >10%.

## G. API polish (dev experience)

-   `fracop(D=alpha, mode="riesz|weyl|tempered", axes=(-1,), dx=1.0, pad="none|3/2|window", learnable_alpha=False, return_spectrum=False)`
-   Clear doc on **conventions** (unitary FFT, angular frequency, periodic domain).
-   Examples: (i) fractional denoising; (ii) fractional heat; (iii) inverse recovery of $\alpha$ from synthetic data; (iv) fSNN membrane with fractional leak.

# 4) Interpreting your NN loss gap (2.3%)

Nice but small. Before claiming systematic convergence gains, run:

-   **5 random seeds × 3 learning rates** and report mean±sd.
-   **Ablate**: with/without 3/2 de-alias; with/without tempered variant; Riesz vs. Weyl (with proper conjugation).
-   **Scaling study**: show the gain grows with $N$ and depth (where the old gradients really suffer).

# 5) Where this becomes publishable

A short tech paper / arXiv note would land if you include:

1.  A clear spectral–adjoint derivation with conventions fixed.
2.  The full test battery (adjoint, semigroup, limits, non-periodic, AMP).
3.  Mellin/log-FFT variant for power-laws.
4.  Two demos: *fractional heat* (exact energy decay) and *inverse α-learning* with uncertainty bands.
5.  Open-source code with CI and reproducible scripts.

------

## Quick diff-level nits (to avoid future paper cuts)

-   Clamp logs: `log(omega.abs().clamp_min(tiny))`.
-   Zero-mode: set explicitly and document.
-   Cache `ω` and `|ω|` tensors; recompute `|ω|^α` only when $\alpha$ changes.
-   Use `rfftn/irfftn` for ND; broadcast kernels with `.reshape([1]*k + list(freq_shape))`.
-   For Weyl, enforce Hermitian symmetry by construction; never “take .real”.
-   Add `torch.compile`/XLA switches; pre-warm FFT plans on first call.

------

Bottom line: you’ve crossed the “works and is fast” bar. To make it *bullet-proof* and broadly usable in your fractional PINNs/SNNs, tighten the edge-case maths (limits, semigroup, boundaries), ship ND + tempered + de-aliasing as first-class options, and lock in CI/perf tests. Do that, and this is a framework people can trust for serious fractional modelling.
