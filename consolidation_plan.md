# Optimization Implementation Consolidation Plan

## Analysis Summary

After examining both the `src/optimisation/` folder and our newly created `src/algorithms/gpu_optimized_methods.py` and `src/algorithms/parallel_optimized_methods.py`, here's what I found:

### Current State

**src/optimisation/ folder (OLDER implementations):**
- Basic JAX GPU implementations with simple FFT convolution
- Basic NUMBA kernels with parallel processing
- Less sophisticated error handling and performance monitoring
- No multi-GPU support or advanced memory management
- Limited configuration options

**src/algorithms/ folder (NEWER implementations):**
- Comprehensive GPU acceleration with multi-GPU support
- Advanced parallel processing with multiple backends (joblib, dask, ray)
- Sophisticated performance monitoring and memory management
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- More robust configuration systems

### Consolidation Strategy

**KEEP (New implementations in src/algorithms/):**
1. `gpu_optimized_methods.py` - More comprehensive than optimization folder
2. `parallel_optimized_methods.py` - More advanced than optimization folder
3. `optimized_methods.py` - Already highly optimized

**CONSOLIDATE/REMOVE (Old implementations in src/optimisation/):**
1. `gpu_optimization.py` - Replace with our new GPU implementations
2. `parallel_computing.py` - Replace with our new parallel implementations
3. `jax_implementations.py` - Basic implementations, keep only unique features
4. `numba_kernels.py` - Basic kernels, keep only unique optimizations

**KEEP (Unique features from optimization folder):**
1. Memory optimization strategies from `numba_kernels.py`
2. Advanced JAX optimization patterns from `jax_implementations.py`
3. Configuration utilities that aren't duplicated

## Recommended Actions

1. **Extract unique features** from optimization folder
2. **Integrate them** into our new implementations
3. **Remove duplicate code** from optimization folder
4. **Update imports** to use consolidated implementations
5. **Update documentation** to reflect the consolidation

## Benefits of Consolidation

- **Eliminate code duplication**
- **Maintain single source of truth** for each optimization
- **Reduce maintenance burden**
- **Improve code quality** by keeping best implementations
- **Simplify import structure**
