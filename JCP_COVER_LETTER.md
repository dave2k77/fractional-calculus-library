Dear Editor-in-Chief,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **"hpfracc: A High-Performance Fractional Calculus Library with Machine Learning Integration and Spectral Autograd Framework"** for consideration for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics.

## **Why This Work is Suitable for JCP**

This manuscript presents a significant computational advance that directly addresses a fundamental challenge in computational physics: the incompatibility between non-local fractional operators and standard automatic differentiation methods. Our work introduces the first practical implementation of automatic differentiation for fractional operators through novel spectral domain transformations, making it highly relevant to JCP's readership of computational physicists and applied mathematicians.

## **Key Contributions**

1. **Novel Spectral Autograd Framework**: We resolve the fundamental incompatibility between non-local fractional operations and standard backpropagation by transforming operations to the spectral domain, achieving O(N log N) complexity.

2. **Rigorous Theoretical Foundation**: Comprehensive convergence proofs, error bounds, and stability analysis provide the mathematical rigor expected by JCP readers.

3. **Significant Performance Improvements**: Our implementation achieves 3-8x speedup over existing fractional calculus libraries while maintaining mathematical accuracy.

4. **Real-World Applications**: Demonstrated superior performance in biomedical signal processing (91.5% vs 87.6% accuracy in EEG classification), showing practical impact beyond theoretical advances.

5. **Production-Ready Implementation**: Comprehensive testing (85%+ coverage), multi-backend support (PyTorch, JAX, NUMBA), and open-source availability ensure reproducibility and community adoption.

## **Computational Physics Relevance**

This work directly addresses computational challenges in:
- **Spectral Methods**: Novel application of Mellin transforms and fractional FFT
- **GPU Computing**: Optimized implementations with automatic mixed precision
- **Numerical Analysis**: Rigorous error bounds and stability analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Integration with neural networks for physics-informed modeling
- **Biomedical Engineering**: Applications in neural signal processing and brain-computer interfaces

## **Novelty and Impact**

Our spectral autograd framework represents a paradigm shift in how fractional operators are computed in neural networks. The transformation from non-local to local operations in the frequency domain opens new possibilities for learning-based solution of complex differential equations with memory effects, which has broad implications for computational physics applications.
