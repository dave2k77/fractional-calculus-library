# Probabilistic Fractional Autograd Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes two key research papers that provide crucial insights for developing probabilistic and stochastic approaches to fractional autograd and optimization:

1. **Schulman et al. (2015)** - "Gradient estimation using stochastic computation graphs"
2. **Qi & Gong (2022)** - "Fractional neural sampling as a theory of spatiotemporal probabilistic computations in neural circuits"

These papers offer groundbreaking approaches that can significantly enhance our fractional autograd framework by incorporating probabilistic computation and advanced stochastic gradient estimation techniques.

## Paper 1: Stochastic Computation Graphs (Schulman et al., 2015)

### Key Contributions

#### 1. Stochastic Computation Graphs Framework
The paper introduces **stochastic computation graphs** - directed acyclic graphs that incorporate both:
- **Deterministic functions**: Standard neural network operations
- **Conditional probability distributions**: Stochastic nodes that introduce randomness

This framework unifies various gradient estimation techniques and provides a systematic approach to handling stochastic operations in neural networks.

#### 2. Automatic Gradient Estimation
The authors develop an algorithm that automatically derives **unbiased gradient estimators** for loss functions defined as expectations over random variables. This is achieved through a modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm.

#### 3. Unified Framework
The approach unifies various existing gradient estimators:
- **Pathwise derivative estimator** (reparameterization trick)
- **Score function estimator** (REINFORCE)
- **Variance reduction techniques**

### Relevance to Fractional Autograd

#### 1. Stochastic Fractional Derivatives
The stochastic computation graphs framework can be extended to handle **stochastic fractional derivatives**, where the fractional order itself becomes a random variable:

```
D^α f(x) where α ~ P(α|θ)
```

This enables:
- **Uncertainty quantification** in fractional order selection
- **Bayesian fractional calculus** with probabilistic fractional orders
- **Robust optimization** under fractional order uncertainty

#### 2. Fractional Stochastic Computation Graphs
We can design **fractional stochastic computation graphs** that combine:
- **Deterministic fractional operators**: Standard fractional derivatives
- **Stochastic fractional operators**: Fractional derivatives with random orders
- **Probabilistic fractional sampling**: Sampling from fractional distributions

#### 3. Enhanced Gradient Estimation
The automatic gradient estimation can be extended to fractional derivatives:

```python
class FractionalStochasticComputationGraph:
    """
    Stochastic computation graph with fractional operators
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.deterministic_nodes = {}  # Standard fractional operators
        self.stochastic_nodes = {}     # Stochastic fractional operators
        self.fractional_distributions = {}  # Fractional order distributions
    
    def add_fractional_stochastic_node(self, name, alpha_dist, method="RL"):
        """

            method: Fractional derivative method
        """
        self.stochastic_nodes[name] = {
            'alpha_dist': alpha_dist,
            'method': method,
            'type': 'fractional_stochastic'
        }
    
    def compute_gradient(self, loss_function):
        """
        Compute gradient using fractional stochastic backpropagation
        """
        # Extend Schulman's algorithm to fractional derivatives
        return self._fractional_stochastic_backprop(loss_function)
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Fractional Reparameterization Trick
Extend the reparameterization trick to fractional derivatives:

def fractional_reparameterization_trick(alpha_dist, epsilon):
    """
    Reparameterize fractional order distribution for gradient estimation
    
    Args:
        alpha_dist: Distribution over fractional orders
        epsilon: Random noise
    
    Returns:
        Reparameterized fractional order
    """
    # For Gaussian distribution: α = μ + σ * ε
    if isinstance(alpha_dist, torch.distributions.Normal):
        alpha = alpha_dist.loc + alpha_dist.scale * epsilon
    else:
        # General reparameterization
        alpha = alpha_dist.rsample()
    
    return alpha
```

#### 2. Fractional Score Function Estimator
Implement score function estimator for fractional derivatives:

```python
def fractional_score_function_estimator(x, alpha_dist, loss_fn):
    """
    Score function estimator for stochastic fractional derivatives
    
    Args:
        x: Input tensor
        alpha_dist: Distribution over fractional orders
        loss_fn: Loss function
    
    Returns:
        Gradient estimate
    """
    # Sample fractional order
    alpha = alpha_dist.sample()
    
    # Compute fractional derivative
    frac_deriv = fractional_derivative(x, alpha)
    
    # Compute loss
    loss = loss_fn(frac_deriv)
    
    # Compute score function gradient
    log_prob = alpha_dist.log_prob(alpha)
    score_grad = loss * log_prob
    
    return score_grad
```

            spatial_effect * temporal_effect, alpha
        )
        
        return frac_dynamics
```
