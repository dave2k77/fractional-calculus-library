# Adapter Performance Analysis & Optimization

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### 1. **Redundant Import Overhead**
- `TensorOps.__init__()` calls `get_adapter()` which triggers `_import_lib()`
- `BackendManager` also imports the same libraries during initialization
- This creates duplicate import overhead and capability detection

### 2. **Capability Detection Redundancy**
- Adapters detect capabilities every time `get_lib()` is called
- `BackendManager` also detects capabilities during initialization
- No caching of capability results

### 3. **Inefficient Backend Selection**
- `TensorOps` has its own backend resolution logic that duplicates `BackendManager`
- No performance-based backend selection
- No consideration of data size or operation type

### 4. **Missing Performance Optimizations**
- No JIT compilation for repeated operations
- No GPU memory management
- No operation-specific backend selection

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. **Lazy Import with Caching**
- Cache imported libraries and capabilities
- Only import when actually needed
- Reuse capability detection results

### 2. **Performance-Based Backend Selection**
- Select backend based on operation type and data size
- Use GPU for large operations, CPU for small ones
- Consider memory constraints

### 3. **Operation-Specific Optimization**
- Use JAX for mathematical operations when available
- Use PyTorch for neural network operations
- Use NumPy for simple array operations

### 4. **Minimal Adapter Overhead**
- Direct library access when performance is critical
- Adapter only for cross-backend compatibility
- Zero-overhead abstractions where possible

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Performance-Optimized Adapter System**
2. **Implement Smart Backend Selection**
3. **Add Operation-Specific Optimizations**
4. **Ensure Zero-Overhead for Direct Library Access**
