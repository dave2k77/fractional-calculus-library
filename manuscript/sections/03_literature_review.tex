\section{Literature Review}

This section provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in fractional calculus, neural networks, and their intersection, focusing on computational methods, machine learning integration, and practical applications. The literature review is organized thematically to highlight key developments and identify research gaps that motivate the development of the HPFRACC framework.

\subsection{Computational Challenges in Fractional Differential Equations}

The computational solution of fractional differential equations presents unique challenges that have been extensively studied in the literature. \citet{Gong2015ComputationalChallengeFDE} provide a comprehensive survey of these challenges and potential solutions, establishing the foundation for understanding the computational complexity of fractional calculus.

\subsubsection{Core Computational Challenges}

Gong et al. identify several fundamental challenges in fractional differential equation solving:

\textbf{Memory Requirements and Non-locality}: The non-local nature of fractional operators requires storing the entire solution history, leading to memory requirements that scale quadratically with the number of time steps. This presents a significant bottleneck for long-time simulations and large-scale problems.

\textbf{Computational Complexity}: Traditional numerical methods for fractional differential equations exhibit $O(N^2)$ computational complexity, where $N$ is the number of time steps. This complexity arises from the need to evaluate fractional derivatives at each time step, involving sums over all previous time points.

\textbf{Numerical Stability}: Fractional differential equations can exhibit numerical instabilities that are not present in classical differential equations. The choice of discretization scheme and time step size becomes critical for maintaining stability while preserving accuracy.

\textbf{Convergence Analysis}: The convergence properties of numerical methods for fractional differential equations depend on the regularity of the solution and the specific fractional operator used. Unlike classical differential equations, where smooth solutions guarantee high-order convergence, fractional operators may introduce singularities that limit convergence rates.

\subsubsection{Proposed Solutions and Methods}

The survey by Gong et al. categorizes existing solutions into several approaches:

\textbf{Finite Difference Methods}: These methods discretize fractional operators using approximations of the Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov definition. The L1 approximation for Caputo fractional derivatives provides first-order accuracy with improved stability properties.

\textbf{Spectral Methods}: High-accuracy methods that expand solutions in terms of orthogonal polynomials. These methods can achieve exponential convergence for smooth solutions but require careful handling of boundary conditions.

\textbf{Adaptive Methods}: Strategies that automatically adjust time steps to maintain accuracy while minimizing computational cost. The challenge lies in developing error estimators that account for the non-local nature of fractional operators.

\textbf{Parallel Computing}: Approaches that distribute computational load across multiple processors. The non-local nature of fractional operators makes parallelization challenging, requiring careful load balancing and communication strategies.

\subsubsection{Research Gaps and Opportunities}

While Gong et al. provide a comprehensive overview of existing methods, several gaps remain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Integration}: The survey predates the widespread adoption of neural networks for differential equation solving, missing opportunities for learning-based approaches.
    \item \textbf{GPU Acceleration}: Limited discussion of modern GPU computing capabilities for fractional calculus computations.
    \item \textbf{Unified Frameworks}: No comprehensive framework that integrates multiple solution methods with consistent APIs.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Applications}: Limited focus on applications requiring real-time or near-real-time computation.
\end{itemize}

These gaps directly motivate the development of HPFRACC, which addresses machine learning integration, GPU acceleration, and unified framework design.
