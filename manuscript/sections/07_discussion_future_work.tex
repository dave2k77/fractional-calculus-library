\section{Discussion and Future Work}

\subsection{Summary of Limitations and Future Directions}

While \hpfracc represents a significant advancement in neural fractional calculus, several limitations and future research directions warrant discussion for reviewers to assess scope and impact.

\subsubsection{Current Limitations}

\textbf{Numerical Constraints}: The framework is currently limited to fractional orders $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ and requires sufficient solution regularity for optimal performance. Memory usage scales quadratically with time horizon for fractional operators, limiting long-time simulations.

\textbf{Computational Resources}: Large neural networks or long time horizons can exceed GPU memory capacity, requiring fallback to CPU computation. Training time scales with problem complexity, particularly for high-dimensional systems.

\textbf{Theoretical Scope}: The framework assumes well-posed fractional differential equations and provides convergence guarantees only for specific problem classes. Not all fractional differential equations have unique solutions.

\subsubsection{Future Research Directions}

\textbf{Immediate Priorities (Release 2.0)}: Extension to neural fractional stochastic differential equations, experimental multi-GPU implementation and validation, and advanced GPU optimizations including tensor cores and mixed precision.

\textbf{Long-term Research}: Multi-fractional calculus with variable orders, complex fractional orders, attention mechanisms for long-range dependencies, and integration with quantum computing frameworks.

\textbf{Clinical Applications}: The framework's superior performance in EEG analysis (91.5\% vs 87.6\% accuracy) demonstrates potential for advancing brain-computer interfaces and neural signal processing applications.

\subsection{Framework Limitations and Constraints}

\subsubsection{Current Implementation Limitations}

While \hpfracc provides a comprehensive framework for neural fractional differential equations and stochastic differential equation solving, several limitations exist in the current implementation that warrant discussion.

\paragraph{Numerical Stability Constraints}
The framework's numerical stability is constrained by several factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fractional Order Range}: Currently limited to $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ for fractional derivatives, which covers most physical applications but excludes some theoretical cases
    \item \textbf{Time Step Constraints}: Very small time steps can lead to numerical instabilities in fractional derivative computations due to the accumulation of roundoff errors
    \item \textbf{Memory Effects}: The non-local nature of fractional operators requires storing the entire solution history, limiting the maximum simulation time for large problems
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Computational Resource Requirements}
The framework's performance is bounded by available computational resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPU Memory}: Large neural networks or long time horizons can exceed GPU memory capacity, requiring fallback to CPU computation
    \item \textbf{Training Time}: Neural fractional ODEs require significant training time, especially for complex dynamics or high-dimensional problems
    \item \textbf{Memory Scaling}: Memory usage scales quadratically with time horizon for fractional operators, limiting long-time simulations
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Theoretical Limitations}
Certain theoretical constraints affect the framework's applicability:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Existence and Uniqueness}: Not all fractional differential equations have unique solutions, and the framework assumes well-posed problems
    \item \textbf{Regularity Requirements}: High accuracy requires sufficient regularity of the solution, which may not hold for all problems
    \item \textbf{Convergence Guarantees}: While the framework achieves excellent empirical results, theoretical convergence guarantees are limited to specific problem classes
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation-Specific Constraints}

\paragraph{Backend Limitations}
Different computation backends have specific constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PyTorch}: Limited to single-precision arithmetic on some GPU architectures, potentially affecting numerical accuracy
    \item \textbf{JAX}: JIT compilation overhead for small problems, and limited support for dynamic control flow
    \item \textbf{NUMBA}: No support for automatic differentiation, limiting its use in training scenarios
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Algorithmic Constraints}
Current algorithmic implementations have specific limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fractional Derivatives}: Direct computation methods have $O(N^2)$ complexity, limiting efficiency for very long time series
    \item \textbf{SDE Solvers}: Fixed time step methods may not be optimal for problems with widely varying time scales
    \item \textbf{Neural Networks}: Standard architectures may not capture all types of dynamics, requiring specialized network designs
\end{itemize}
