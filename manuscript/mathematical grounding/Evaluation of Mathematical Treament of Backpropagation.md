# Evaluation of *“Mathematical Treatment of Backpropagation Through Non-Local Fractional Operators”*

**Author’s Note:** This report critically evaluates the mathematical foundations presented in the document *“Mathematical Treatment of Backpropagation Through Non-Local Fractional Operators”*. We address each major aspect of the framework – from fractional  calculus definitions and spectral transform techniques, to complexity  and stability claims, algorithmic design, and comparisons with existing  literature – providing verification, insights, and potential concerns.  All statements are supported with relevant sources, and the critique is  written in British English for clarity.

## 1. Fractional Calculus Foundations and Fractional Chain Rule

**Riemann–Liouville Fractional Derivative:** The document correctly begins with the Riemann–Liouville (RL)  definition of a fractional derivative. In general, for order  $0<\alpha<n$ (with $n=\lceil \alpha \rceil$ an integer), the RL  derivative is defined via an $n$-fold differentiation of an integral of  the function’s history. The provided formula,

RLDαf(x)=1Γ(n−α)dndxn∫0xf(t)(x−t)α−n+1 dt,RLDαf(x)=Γ(n−α)1dxndn∫0x(x−t)α−n+1f(t)dt,

matches standard references for the RL fractional derivative[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=t f ,8)[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=Namely%2C the Laplace transform of,controller can be realized by). This definition highlights the *non-locality* of fractional differentiation: the derivative at point $x$ depends on the entire function history from $0$ to $x$. This non-local convolutional nature is accurately noted as a core  challenge for automatic differentiation (each fractional derivative  computation requires accumulating contributions from all prior points,  leading to heavy memory and computation costs).

**Breakdown of the Standard Chain Rule:** A key point raised is that the ordinary chain rule $d[f(g(x))]/dx =  f'(g(x)),g'(x)$ no longer holds in a simple form for fractional orders.  This is a well-founded concern: fractional calculus does not satisfy the usual local differentiation rules because of the global coupling. The  document proposes a *fractional chain rule* in the form of an infinite series expansion:

Dα[f(g(x))]=∑k=0∞(αk)  Dα−k[f](g(x))  Dk[g](x),Dα[f(g(x))]=∑k=0∞(kα)Dα−k[f](g(x))Dk[g](x),

where $\binom{\alpha}{k}$ are  generalised (fractional) binomial coefficients. This formula is  reminiscent of the fractional generalisation of Leibniz’ rule or Faà di  Bruno’s formula for higher-order derivatives. It suggests expressing the fractional derivative of a composite function as an infinite series of  terms involving fractional derivatives of the outer function and  ordinary (or fractional) derivatives of the inner function. While this  series **formally**  appears in some treatments of fractional calculus, its rigorous  justification can be non-trivial. In general, convergence and  applicability of the infinite series require analytic function  expansions or certain function classes – it is not a universally  applicable “chain rule” in the classical sense[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378804452_Implementation_of_Caputo_type_fractional_derivative_chain_rule_on_back_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Fractional gradient computation is a,for the use of any). Recent research confirms that tackling the chain rule for fractional  derivatives analytically is challenging: Candan and Çubukçu (2024)  derive a fractional chain rule for Caputo derivatives using the Faà di  Bruno formula, addressing how to truncate or bound the infinite series  for practical use[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378804452_Implementation_of_Caputo_type_fractional_derivative_chain_rule_on_back_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Fractional gradient computation is a,for the use of any). The document’s series expansion aligns qualitatively with such  approaches, but it should be noted that this is more of a formal  identity than a ready-to-use rule in computations. In practice,  implementing backpropagation through a composite fractional operator  might rely on either truncating this series or, as the framework under  review does, bypassing it via a spectral method.

**Rigour and Definition Choices:** It is important that the document uses the Riemann–Liouville definition for theoretical exposition. The RL derivative has certain quirks (e.g.  the RL derivative of a constant is not zero), which can complicate  intuitive interpretations. In some applications (especially differential equations), the Caputo derivative is preferred because it yields zero  for constant functions and shifts initial conditions to the  differentiable part of the operator. The underlying spectral approach,  however, is largely independent of whether one uses RL or Caputo for  $\alpha>0$, as both share the same principal symbol in the frequency  domain (differing mainly in how initial history is handled). The  document does not explicitly address which definition is assumed during  implementation, but implicitly an RL-type definition from 0 is used with the assumption that any necessary initial terms (e.g. the fractional  integral from $-\infty$ to 0 or initial value terms) are either zero or  accounted for. For a rigorous treatment, one would need to ensure that  the function $f(x)$ satisfies conditions (such as $f(0)=0$ and  sufficient decay or smoothness) so that the fractional derivative and  its transforms are well-defined. In summary, the foundational definition given is mathematically sound and highlights the difficulties  (non-local memory and chain rule issues) that any solution must  overcome.

**Verification:** The issues listed – non-locality, $O(n^2)$ memory/computation growth,  and breakdown of the naive chain rule – are well known in fractional  calculus and fractional differential equations. These points establish a need for alternative methods (like the spectral approach) to perform  backpropagation. The use of a formal fractional chain rule series  indicates mathematical awareness of how fractional differentiation  distributes over composition, but it also signals that directly applying such a rule is impractical. We agree that a more tractable approach  (such as the spectral method chosen) is warranted, since directly  handling the infinite series or the integral definition in an automatic  differentiation framework would be highly complex or infeasible. In  conclusion, the document’s fractional calculus foundations are **mathematically correct**, but the fractional chain rule as presented should be taken as a formal  guideline rather than a rigorously proven formula for all cases. It  underscores why the authors pivot to a spectral-domain solution instead  of attempting to apply that series in a computation.

## 2. Spectral Domain Treatment: Fourier and Mellin Transforms and Adjoint Operators

**Transforming Non-Local Operators to Local Multipliers:** The central insight of the spectral autograd framework is that **fractional differentiation becomes algebraic multiplication in an appropriate spectral domain**. This is a well-established property in classical analysis: convolution  in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency  domain. Since fractional differentiation of RL/Caputo type can be  represented as a convolution with a power-law kernel, it is natural that taking the Fourier or Mellin transform converts it to a simpler  operation. The document correctly states the Fourier transform property:

F ⁣[Dαf](ω)=(i ω)α  F[f](ω) .F[Dαf](ω)=(iω)αF[f](ω).

This formula is a standard result for fractional derivatives (interpreted in the sense of distributions if necessary). It can be derived by observing that the Laplace transform of an RL  fractional derivative is $s^{\alpha}F(s)$ (assuming zero initial  conditions)[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=t f ,8), and by substituting $s = i\omega$ one obtains the Fourier transform relation[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=Namely%2C the Laplace transform of,controller can be realized by). The factor $(i\omega)^\alpha$ serves as the *symbol* of the fractional derivative operator in the frequency domain. This is  consistent with known results in fractional calculus literature (for  example, for $\alpha=1$ one recovers the usual $\mathcal{F}[f'] =  i\omega \mathcal{F}[f]$). We note that $(i\omega)^\alpha$ is in general a complex-valued function of $\omega$; when $\alpha$ is not an integer,  care must be taken in defining this power (choice of branch cut for the  complex power) and in interpreting the transform for negative  frequencies. The document does not explicitly discuss the multi-valued  nature of $(i\omega)^\alpha$, but it later acknowledges the issue of  branch cuts. In practical terms, one common convention is to define  $(i\omega)^\alpha = |\omega|^\alpha e^{i\alpha\pi/2}$ for $\omega\ge0$  and $|\omega|^\alpha e^{-i\alpha\pi/2}$ for $\omega<0$ (this  corresponds to the Fourier symbol of the Riesz fractional derivative, an even symmetric operator). Another approach is to restrict to causal  transforms (Laplace domain) or use the Mellin transform for $x>0$ to  avoid dealing with negative frequencies at all. The document correctly  identifies the *Mellin transform* as an alternative when the problem is naturally posed on $[0,\infty)$ (e.g. for scaling behaviours):

M[Dαf](s)=sα  M[f](s) .M[Dαf](s)=sαM[f](s).

This Mellin property is plausible  because differentiation in $x$ corresponds to multiplication by a power  of the Mellin dual variable $s$. (In fact, Mellin transform converts  scaling convolution to multiplication, making it suitable for  multiplicative operators like $x^\beta D^\alpha$ if needed.) The use of  Mellin vs Fourier would depend on the nature of the fractional operator  and domain of $f(x)$. The framework’s flexibility in choosing Fourier *or* Mellin (or even Laplace) is a strength: it acknowledges that a single  transform may not be optimal for all situations, and an adaptive choice  can mitigate issues like non-periodicity or heavy-tailed behaviour.

**Local Multiplication and Adjoint in Spectral Space:** By converting the fractional derivative into a multiplication by  $(i\omega)^\alpha$ (or $s^\alpha$), the document claims a major  reduction in complexity: the inherently $O(n^2)$ convolution is replaced by $O(1)$ work per frequency component (with the overhead of  transforms, typically $O(n\log n)$). This claim is justified –  convolution integrals of length $n$ becoming pointwise products of $n$  frequency samples indeed change the scaling. A table is provided  contrasting direct vs spectral complexities, which we will examine in the next section. Here, we focus on the *adjoint* (backward) operation. The backward pass in autograd must apply the  adjoint (transpose) of the forward linear operation. In the time domain, the adjoint of a fractional derivative (with appropriate inner product  weighting) is a fractional integral of the same order (for RL  derivatives on [0,T], one might need integration by parts to see the  adjoint relationship, but conceptually it holds under suitable boundary  conditions). In the spectral domain, taking adjoint corresponds to  multiplying by the complex conjugate of the symbol (because the Fourier  transform is unitary in $L^2$ and the adjoint of multiplication by  $H(\omega)$ is multiplication by $\overline{H(\omega)}$). The document  verifies the adjoint property by checking inner products:

⟨Dαf,  g⟩=⟨f,  (Dα)∗g⟩,⟨Dαf,g⟩=⟨f,(Dα)∗g⟩,

which in the Fourier domain translates to

⟨(iω)αF[f],  F[g]⟩=⟨F[f],  (iω)α‾  F[g]⟩ 

⟨(iω)αF[f],F[g]⟩=⟨F[f],(iω)αF[g]⟩

For real fractional orders  $\alpha$, $\overline{(i\omega)^{\alpha}} = (-i\omega)^{\alpha}$, since  complex conjugation of $i^\alpha$ yields $(-i)^\alpha$. Thus, the  adjoint operator in frequency is multiplication by $(-i\omega)^\alpha$  for the Fourier case (and by $s^{-\alpha}$ for the Mellin case). The pseudocode given in the document’s *SpectralFractionalBackward* function correctly implements this: in the Fourier branch it multiplies the gradient’s spectrum by $(-,i\omega)^\alpha$, and in the Mellin branch by $s^{-\alpha}$. This is precisely what we expect: since the forward pass did  $Y(\omega)= (i\omega)^\alpha X(\omega)$, the backward must do  $X_{\text{grad}}(\omega) =  \overline{(i\omega)^\alpha};Y_{\text{grad}}(\omega)$ to obtain the  gradient wrt the input. We find this treatment **mathematically sound**. It is essentially applying the well-known property that fractional  differential operators are self-adjoint (in the Fourier sense) when  $\alpha$ is real and we assume zero boundary contributions. Minor  caveats: if $\alpha$ is not purely real (not the case here) or if the  inner product weight is not uniform, modifications would be needed.  Also, for Mellin transforms, one must ensure using the proper inner  product (which involves integration in the Mellin $s$-plane with a  complex conjugate symmetry) so that $s^{-\alpha}$ is indeed the adjoint  symbol to $s^\alpha$. The document assumes these details implicitly;  from an implementation standpoint, verifying the adjointness via inner  products as done above is sufficient.

**Spectral Domain Conclusions:** The spectral-domain formulation is **conceptually correct** and leverages classical transform theory effectively. By handling  fractional differentiation as multiplication in the transform domain,  the approach bypasses the direct use of the fractional chain rule.  Notably, the document points out that in the spectral representation,  the “non-local dependencies” are handled automatically – meaning the  transform inherently accounts for the global nature of the operator, so  we do not have to manually track long-range interactions in the  computational graph. This is a valid and powerful observation also  reflected in other fields: for example, pseudo-spectral methods for  fractional partial differential equations use a similar strategy by  diagonalising the fractional operator in a basis of eigenfunctions (such as Fourier modes)[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=Namely%2C the Laplace transform of,controller can be realized by). One point of rigor: when applying Fourier transforms in practice (via  FFT), one assumes the data is periodic or padded – otherwise one risks *spectral leakage*. The document identifies spectral leakage as a numerical issue and  suggests mitigating it (e.g. through periodisation or using the Laplace  transform for non-periodic signals). This shows an understanding that  the mathematical transform has certain prerequisites (signal periodicity or decay) that must be managed in implementation. In summary, the  Fourier and Mellin domain treatment and the adjoint formulation given  are **correct**, and they form a solid mathematical backbone for the proposed autograd framework.

## 3. Computational Complexity and Numerical Stability

**Complexity Analysis:** The document contrasts the *direct* fractional backpropagation approach with the *spectral* approach in terms of time complexity and memory usage. For a sequence (or layer output) of length $n$, a naive time-domain  implementation of an RL fractional derivative requires $O(n)$ work *per output element* (since each new point integrates over all previous points). This yields $O(n^2)$ operations for the forward pass of one layer, and similarly  $O(n^2)$ for backpropagating gradients through that layer. In addition,  storing intermediate states for backprop could naively require $O(n^2)$  memory if one kept the entire history kernel or a full Jacobian. These  scalings are forbiddingly high except for very small $n$. The spectral  method, by contrast, performs an FFT (or Mellin transform) which is  $O(n\log n)$, multiplies by the spectral response ($O(n)$), and then an  inverse transform ($O(n\log n)$). Thus forward and backward passes each  scale on the order of $n\log n$. This is a dramatic improvement, as also noted in the document’s complexity table: the spectral fractional method is *asymptotically* much faster and uses linear memory. These claims are credible and align with known results in signal  processing: computing a convolution via FFT becomes advantageous once  $n$ exceeds the break-even point (typically a few dozen points). The  table shows the backward pass for the direct method as “$O(n^2)$ per  layer”, which implies that computing gradients by direct differentiation of the convolution would also scale quadratically in the worst case.  The spectral method’s backward pass is $O(n\log n)$, essentially the  cost of two FFTs and one multiplication, which is consistent with the  pseudocode.

One should note that the constant factors in FFT-based methods are higher than in a simple $O(n)$ loop,  so for very small $n$ a direct method might still be faster. However,  fractional operators usually come into play for modelling long-memory  processes, where $n$ could be large (time series, signals, long  sequences in neural networks, etc.), so the asymptotic gain is highly  relevant. Also, if one had *many* fractional-derivative layers in a deep network, the cost multiplies by  the number of such layers. In that scenario, $O(n^2)$ per layer would be completely infeasible, whereas $O(n\log n)$ per layer may be  acceptable. The memory efficiency of the spectral approach (claimed  $O(n)$ vs $O(n^2)$) comes from the fact that we no longer need to store  every intermediate convolution value or a full history matrix – we only  need to store the spectral representation for use in backprop. Indeed,  the algorithm stores $(X_{\text{spectral}}, Y_{\text{spectral}}, \alpha, \text{method})$ for each layer. These objects have size $O(n)$ each  (essentially two arrays of length $n$ plus a few scalars), instead of  storing the entire convolution kernel or all intermediate states. This  is a huge memory saving and mirrors the “activations vs gradients”  trade-off common in deep learning: normally one must store activations  for backprop, but here the *activation* (output) can be recomputed from the spectral data if needed, or we can  directly propagate gradients via the saved spectral multipliers.

**Underlying Assumptions:** The complexity analysis assumes that an FFT or similar transform is  applicable. This implies that $n$ points of the function are available  as a discrete sequence. In an actual continuous setting, one might have  to discretise the fractional operator anyway, so it’s fair to compare on those terms. Also, it assumes that using the full $n$-point FFT is  valid – if the fractional operator has a very long impulse response  (which it does), one must either pad the signal to avoid circular  convolution issues or use an overlap-save strategy for very long  time-series. Such details are beyond the scope of the complexity table,  but worth mentioning: if one were to process a streaming signal in  chunks, the transform of each chunk is $O(m\log m)$ for chunk size $m$,  but handling chunk boundaries with fractional memory might introduce  some overhead (the document’s mention of “chunked processing” suggests  dividing the operation on very long sequences to manage memory). Nevertheless, the overall scaling remains $O(n\log n)$ per chunk, so the big-O improvement stands.

**Numerical Stability and Error Considerations:** Fractional spectral methods must contend with several numerical issues, which the document identifies clearly:

-   **Spectral Leakage:** Using the FFT assumes periodic extension of the signal. A non-periodic  or non-smooth extension can cause high-frequency leakage (Gibbs  phenomena, etc.). The document flags this and suggests that one might  choose other transforms (like the Laplace transform for non-periodic  signals on $[0,\infty)$, or apply windowing/overlap techniques). Another common mitigation is padding the signal with zeros (or a smooth fade)  to reduce wrap-around discontinuities. The text’s recommendation of  adaptive transform choice (Fourier vs Mellin vs Laplace) is a sensible  strategy to ensure stability: e.g. Mellin for multiplicative processes  (to avoid large dynamic range issues), Laplace for semi-infinite domain  problems (to naturally incorporate initial conditions and  non-periodicity), and Fourier for inherently periodic or stationary  signals. This adaptive approach is evidence of the authors’  understanding that **no single spectral method is universally optimal** – a practical point often echoed in computational harmonic analysis literature.
-   **Fractional Powers & Branch Cuts:** The factor $(i\omega)^\alpha$ (or $s^\alpha$) can be problematic  numerically. If $\alpha$ is not an integer, $(i\omega)^\alpha =  e^{\alpha \ln(i\omega)}$ involves complex exponentiation. Two main  issues arise: (1) at $\omega=0$, $(i\omega)^\alpha$ is 0 for  $\alpha>0$, which is fine, but for $\alpha<0$ (a fractional  integral) it would blow up – presumably, the framework is focused on  fractional derivatives (orders $\alpha>0$) so we avoid that  singularity. (2) For large $|\omega|$, $(i\omega)^\alpha$ grows as  $|\omega|^\alpha$, so if $\alpha$ is positive, high-frequency components get amplified (potentially amplifying high-frequency noise). If  $\alpha$ is between 0 and 1, this is not too severe, but for  $\alpha>1$ it can cause numerical instability unless the input is  sufficiently smooth (differentiating accentuates noise). Additionally,  fractional powers of negative numbers require a branch cut in the  complex plane; typically the negative real axis is chosen as a branch  cut for the logarithm, meaning that $\ln(i\omega)$ jumps when $\omega$  changes sign. This is tied to the periodic extension issue and symmetry  of the transform. The document specifically notes the **branch cut problem** and the multi-valued nature of complex fractional power. As a solution, one suggestion given is **regularisation**: for example, replacing $s^\alpha$ with $(s^2+\varepsilon^2)^{\alpha/2}$. This is a common trick to avoid singularities at $s=0$ or $\omega=0$:  by adding a small $\varepsilon$, one effectively moves the branch cut  slightly off the axis or avoids undefined $0^0$ forms. Such  regularisation ensures that extremely low frequencies do not lead to  divergent phase factors or undefined values. It also stabilises  inversion of the Mellin/Laplace transform in cases of fractional  integration. The document only briefly mentions this  $(s^2+\epsilon^2)^{\alpha/2}$ idea, but it likely serves to avoid  division by zero or heavy amplification of low frequencies (for  instance, in a fractional integral where $\alpha$ is negative, this  would tame the $s^{\alpha}$ growth as $s\to0$).
-   **Transform Accuracy:** Inverse transforms, especially Mellin or Laplace, may require numerical integration or series expansion. The FFT is exact up to machine  precision for well-behaved periodic signals, but the *Mellin transform* might be implemented via discretisation that introduces approximation  error. The mention of “numerical integration for inverse transforms”  highlights that some transforms (like Mellin) do not have a simple  built-in FFT algorithm. In practice, a Mellin transform might be  computed by mapping to frequency domain via $\omega = \ln x$ and using  an FFT (since Mellin convolution becomes ordinary convolution in log  domain), or by using Gauss–Jacobi quadrature if an analytic form is  known. Each method has errors: e.g. using FFT for Mellin requires  interpolation on a log-uniform grid; numerical inversion of Laplace  requires Bromwich contour integration, which can be tricky. The  framework presumably avoids heavy numerical integration by focusing on  Fourier (which is efficiently invertible via FFT) and by carefully  selecting transforms. The text suggests using theoretical error bounds  and perhaps comparing results with known analytical solutions. Indeed, they included a **numerical validation example** (fractional derivative of $f(x)=x^2$ for $\alpha=0.5$) to show the  computed result matches the analytical formula $D^{0.5}x^2 =  \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)}x^{1.5}$. This kind of test is crucial: it  verifies that the spectral method yields correct results for a known  ground truth, and it allows estimation of error. The example given is a  simple polynomial where the fractional derivative is known in closed  form, and indeed they report the expected coefficient $1.5045\cdot  x^{1.5}$.
-   **Stability of Inversion and Finite Precision:** Although not explicitly detailed in the document, one should consider  that multiplying by $(i\omega)^\alpha$ could lead to large phase  rotations. For instance, if $\alpha=0.5$, $(i\omega)^{0.5} =  \sqrt{|\omega|} e^{i,\text{sgn}(\omega)\pi/4}$, so there’s a phase of  $\pi/4$ for positive $\omega$ and $-\pi/4$ for negative $\omega$. The  discontinuity in phase at $\omega=0$ might introduce a mild Gibbs effect in time domain if not handled. Finite precision could also suffer if  $\omega$ is very large and $\alpha$ large, due to power of large  numbers. However, these are edge cases; for typical $\alpha \in (0,2]$  and moderate signal lengths, FFT double precision is sufficient.

In summary, the document demonstrates a **clear understanding of the numerical stability issues** and proposes reasonable remedies (regularisation, adaptive transform selection, chunking, error analysis). The *chunked processing* solution is worth expanding: since fractional effects decay over time  (albeit slowly for long memory), one can split a long signal into  segments and process each with spectral methods, carrying over some  “memory state” between segments. This avoids doing an impractically  large transform for extremely long sequences and keeps memory usage  linear. This idea is akin to the “short-memory principle” used in  fractional order simulations[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=There are many ways to,methods need truncation of the), where one truncates the convolution tail beyond a certain lag, incurring a controlled error. The document’s mention of *error bounds* suggests they are aware of theoretical results that bound the  truncation or discretisation error for fractional operators – many such  results exist in numerical fractional calculus literature (e.g. error of FFT-based convolution vs exact, error of finite impulse response  approximation, etc.). It would be ideal if the document cited specific  error analyses, but given this is an overview, the gesture towards  theoretical error analysis is acceptable.

**Bottom Line:** The complexity improvement claims are **validated** by known computational complexity theory (FFT vs naive convolution).  The memory savings claim is also valid and crucial for scaling to larger problems. On the stability front, the authors have identified the main  pitfalls and suggested sensible approaches. No obvious stability issue  has been overlooked: periodicity assumptions, branch cut issues, and  transform accuracy are the key ones and were all mentioned. We find the  claims of efficiency and the discussions of stability to be **correct**, with the understanding that real-world implementation will require  careful engineering (as acknowledged by the proposed solutions). The  assumptions made (sufficient smoothness, zero initial history outside  the domain, etc.) are typical in fractional calculus computations and  would need to be ensured for the theory to apply. As a critique, one  could note that the document does not detail how to choose between  Fourier, Mellin, or Laplace in a given scenario – in practice, one would consider the domain of definition of the function and the kernel  properties. For instance, if the input signal is on $[0, T]$ and is not  naturally periodic, one might lean towards a Laplace transform or pad  the signal in Fourier; if the fractional operator is scale-invariant  (like a Mellin convolution), Mellin could be more accurate. Providing a  flowchart or criteria for this choice could strengthen the framework,  but the mention itself is a good acknowledgement of the issue. Overall, the computational complexity and stability analysis are **well-founded** and lend confidence that the method can be efficient and accurate when implemented carefully.

## 4. Algorithmic Structure: Forward and Backward Spectral Passes

The document outlines two  algorithms, a forward pass and an adjoint backward pass, to integrate  the spectral method into an automatic differentiation system. We evaluate these step by step:

**Spectral Fractional Forward Pass (Algorithm 1):** The pseudocode describes a function `SpectralFractionalForward(x, α, method='fourier')` which computes the fractional derivative of input array `x` of order $\alpha$. The key steps are:

1.  **Transform to Spectral Domain:** If `method == 'fourier'`, it computes `X_spectral = FFT(x)` and prepares a frequency vector $\omega$ of appropriate length, then  computes $Y_{\text{spectral}} = (1j \cdot \omega)^{\alpha} \cdot  X_{\text{spectral}}$. If `method == 'mellin'`, it computes `X_spectral = MellinTransform(x)`, obtains the Mellin variable array `s`, and computes $Y_{\text{spectral}} = s^{\alpha} \cdot X_{\text{spectral}}$. This corresponds exactly to applying the mathematical formulas  $\mathcal{F}[D^\alpha x] = (i\omega)^\alpha \mathcal{F}[x]$ and  $\mathcal{M}[D^\alpha x] = s^\alpha \mathcal{M}[x]$, as discussed  earlier. The pseudocode uses `(1j * ω)^α`, which in Python-like syntax means $(i\omega)^\alpha$, consistent with the theory.

    One **minor detail**: after the spectral multiplication, for consistency one should perform  the inverse transform corresponding to the forward transform used. The  code shows `y = IFFT(Y_spectral)` regardless of method. If `method='mellin'`, one would expect an inverse Mellin transform rather than an inverse  FFT. We interpret this as a simplification in pseudocode – presumably, `IFFT` is meant to represent the inverse of whichever transform was applied  (be it inverse Fourier or inverse Mellin). Clarifying this in an  implementation would be important (e.g. by calling a generic `InverseTransform()` that dispatches to `IFFT` or `InvMellin` appropriately). As written, the Mellin branch would be incorrect if it  literally used an IFFT, but we believe this is just a notational  shortcut in the document. In practice, implementing the Mellin transform might involve mapping to a Fourier domain via $\log x$, but that is an  implementation nuance.

2.  **Inverse Transform to Physical Domain:** The result `y` is obtained by inverse transforming `Y_spectral`. This yields the fractional derivative (or a close numerical  approximation of it) in the time domain. The algorithm then saves the  spectral data needed for backprop and returns `y`. The saved data includes `X_spectral` (the original spectrum), `Y_spectral`, the order $\alpha$, and the method used. Storing both `X_spectral` and `Y_spectral` might be redundant – in principle, one of them plus the knowledge of  $\alpha$ could reproduce the other (since $Y_{\text{spectral}} =  (i\omega)^\alpha X_{\text{spectral}}$). However, having both could be  convenient for debugging or if one wants to verify the forward  computation. It does use memory, but only $O(n)$ as discussed, which is  fine. If memory were a concern, one might store only `X_spectral` and recompute $Y_{\text{spectral}}$ during backward if needed, but that’s a minor optimisation.

The forward algorithm corresponds well with how one would implement a custom autograd function in a  library like PyTorch or TensorFlow: do the transform, multiply by the  filter in spectral domain, inverse transform, and cache any data needed  for the gradient.

**Spectral Fractional Backward Pass (Algorithm 2):** The backward function `SpectralFractionalBackward(grad_output, saved_spectral_data)` uses the saved data from forward to compute the gradient with respect to the input. It performs:

1.  **Transform Gradient to Spectral Domain:** `Grad_spectral = FFT(grad_output)` (or the appropriate transform). This takes the gradient of the loss with respect to the *output* $y$ and converts it into the spectral domain. This step is analogous to how, in ordinary convolution, one would transform the output gradient  to multiply by the conjugate filter.

2.  **Apply Adjoint Operator:** Depending on the method, it multiplies by the adjoint spectral factor. For Fourier, it computes `Adj_spectral = ((-1j * ω)^α) * Grad_spectral`. This is effectively $( -i\omega)^\alpha \cdot  \mathcal{F}[\text{grad}_y]$, which, as reasoned earlier, is the spectral representation of the fractional *adjoint* operator. For Mellin, it does `Adj_spectral = s^(-α) * Grad_spectral`, corresponding to multiplication by $s^{-\alpha}$. Both are consistent  with the inner product analysis and represent $(D^\alpha)^*$ applied in  the transform domain.

    To double-check: if $Y = D^\alpha X$ in forward, and we have $\nabla_Y$ as `grad_output`, then we want $\nabla_X = (D^\alpha)^* \nabla_Y$. In Fourier, $Y(\omega) = (i\omega)^\alpha X(\omega)$, so $\nabla_X(\omega) =  \overline{(i\omega)^\alpha} , \nabla_Y(\omega) = (-i\omega)^\alpha  \nabla_Y(\omega)$, which is exactly what the code does. In Mellin, $Y(s) = s^\alpha X(s)$ (here $s$ is the Mellin frequency), so $\nabla_X(s) =  s^{-\alpha} \nabla_Y(s)$, matching the code. Thus, algorithmically it is **correct**.

3.  **Inverse Transform to Get Input Gradient:** Finally, `grad_input = IFFT(Adj_spectral)` (or inverse Mellin) is performed, yielding the gradient with respect to the input $x$ in the time domain. This `grad_input` would then be used by the autograd engine to propagate further down the computational graph.

This backward algorithm is  efficient – it requires one forward FFT of the grad (or similar  transform) and one inverse FFT, plus $O(n)$ multiplications for the  adjoint operation. This is symmetrical to the forward pass complexity.  The storage of `Y_spectral` in forward might not even be needed for computing `grad_input` (notice that the backward code does not actually use `Y_spectral` or `X_spectral` from the saved data in the current pseudocode, except perhaps implicitly to know length or frequency vector size). Potentially, one might also want the saved `X_spectral` if computing gradients with respect to $\alpha$ or to some parameter in the operator – but that is beyond the standard backprop for inputs.

**Gradient Propagation Through Fractional Operators:** With this setup, gradients are propagated exactly as they would be  through a linear layer (like a convolution) but with the fractional  spectral filter providing the weighting. This is important: it  demonstrates that despite the fractional operator’s original non-local  definition, in the computational graph it behaves like a linear layer  with a known frequency response. Therefore, the gradient propagation is  stable and well-defined. One must ensure that the chosen transform and  its inverse are differentiable (they are, being linear operations  themselves). In frameworks, FFT is often treated as a primitive  operation that can propagate gradients (though typically one doesn’t  need to differentiate through the FFT algorithm itself; here it’s used  to compute gradients for something else). The adjointness guarantees we  get the correct gradient.

**Adjoint Consistency:** The document explicitly verifies the adjoint consistency by the inner product check, which we’ve discussed. This is a strong form of unit test for the  backward pass: if the equality $\langle D^\alpha f, g\rangle = \langle  f, (D^\alpha)^* g\rangle$ holds numerically for all test functions $f,  g$, the backward implementation is correct. Since the spectral approach  essentially leverages unitary transforms, it inherits the stability and  consistency of those transforms. There’s no need for manual  differentiation of the convolution integral or tricky limit processes –  all that heavy lifting is done analytically by the transform properties.

**Potential Pitfalls and Implementation Details:** A few practical considerations for the algorithmic structure:

-   **Precomputation of Frequency Arrays:** The pseudocode calls a function `frequency_vector(length(x))` to obtain the $\omega$ array (e.g. $[0,1,...,N/2,-N/2+1,...,-1]$ in FFT convention). This is fine, but one must be careful to match the FFT  implementation’s frequency ordering (for instance, `numpy.fft.fftfreq` or similar). Any mismatch in how frequencies are ordered (especially  for odd $n$) could lead to errors in $(i\omega)^\alpha$ assignment.
-   **Mellin Transform Implementation:** The `mellin_variable(length(x))` suggests creating an array of Mellin-domain variables (which might be  something like $s_k$ corresponding to frequencies in $\log$ domain). A  discrete Mellin transform is less straightforward than FFT. One approach is to use the FFT on log-scaled data: i.e. if we have samples $x_j$ on a geometric sequence, the Mellin transform becomes a DFT. The document  doesn’t explicate, but an implementation could resample the input onto a log-uniform grid (if not already uniform in log) to approximate the  Mellin transform. This will involve interpolation and could introduce  error if not done carefully. That said, providing the Mellin path as an  option is commendable because certain fractional operators (like those  arising in scale-invariant systems) might be handled much more  accurately there.
-   **Multiple Fractional Layers and Non-linearities:** The algorithms given treat a single forward and backward through one  fractional operator. In a neural network, we may have multiple such  layers interleaved with nonlinearities. In that case, each fractional  layer would perform its own FFT and IFFT in forward and backward. There  is an opportunity (not discussed in the document) to combine operations  if consecutive fractional layers exist *without* intervening nonlinearities – they could be merged into one spectral  operation by multiplying their frequency responses. However, in a  typical network, one has activation functions in between, so one cannot  combine them directly because the nonlinearity is applied in the time  domain. Thus, each fractional layer will independently do transforms.  This is acceptable; the cost scales with the number of fractional layers times $n\log n$ each. If the network has only one or a few fractional  layers (e.g. the first layer being a fractional filter, followed by  standard layers), the overhead is small. If a network were to have many  such layers, one might consider if it’s cheaper to keep the data in  spectral domain across some layers – but since activations are pointwise (non-spectral), you’d still have to transform back to apply ReLU or  similar. So the design given is reasonable and likely the simplest  approach.
-   **Differentiating with respect to $\alpha$:** The document’s scope is backpropagating through the operator for gradients w.rt *inputs* and standard network weights. If $\alpha$ itself is a parameter to  learn (which could be the case in some fractional models), one would  need the derivative of the output w.rt $\alpha$. The spectral formula  $Y_{\text{spectral}} = (i\omega)^\alpha X_{\text{spectral}}$ can be  differentiated w.rt $\alpha$ to give a factor $\log(i\omega) \cdot  (i\omega)^\alpha X_{\text{spectral}}$ in the spectral domain (since  $\partial (i\omega)^\alpha / \partial \alpha = (i\omega)^\alpha  \ln(i\omega)$). Implementing this would require the backward function to also compute an $\alpha$-gradient: essentially an inner product of the  gradient with $Y_{\text{spectral}}$ weighted by a log factor. The  current pseudocode does not cover this, but it’s something to consider  if fractional orders are trainable. This omission doesn’t invalidate  anything, but it is an extension to keep in mind for completeness.

In conclusion, the algorithmic structure is **well-designed** for the task. It mirrors the structure of typical linear convolution  layers in deep learning libraries, with analogous forward and backward  methods, but swaps time-domain convolution for spectral-domain  multiplication. The pseudocode is easy to follow and implement. Our only recommendation would be to clarify the inverse transform usage for  Mellin vs Fourier, and ensure the code uses the correct inverse  operation depending on the branch. Aside from that small issue, the  approach to gradient propagation is **entirely correct** and indeed elegant. By using the spectral domain, the framework avoids  ever explicitly constructing large Jacobian matrices or doing  complicated chain rule computations in the time domain – all of that is  neatly encapsulated in the transform. This confirms that *from an algorithmic standpoint, the spectral autograd method is both correct and efficient*.

## 5. Comparison with Alternative Approaches in the Literature

Developing automatic  differentiation (backpropagation) for fractional operators is a  relatively new area, and the document’s spectral approach is one novel  contribution. It is useful to compare this with other methods that have  been explored:

**Discrete Fractional Difference Approaches:** One straightforward approach in literature is to approximate fractional derivatives by discrete fractional differences (e.g. Grünwald–Letnikov  (GL) formula or finite impulse response filters) and then apply standard backpropagation through those approximations. For instance, Gomulka  (2018) introduced a neural network training algorithm using a *fractional order derivative mechanism* based on the GL definition[itm-conferences.org](https://www.itm-conferences.org/articles/itmconf/pdf/2018/06/itmconf_cst2018_00004.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,and the mechanism of smooth). In that work, the fractional derivative is approximated by a weighted  sum of past values (essentially a convolution with binomial  coefficients), and the backpropagation algorithm was modified  accordingly to adjust weights using those fractional difference terms[itm-conferences.org](https://www.itm-conferences.org/articles/itmconf/pdf/2018/06/itmconf_cst2018_00004.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,and the mechanism of smooth). While this approach demonstrated the feasibility of training networks  with fractional dynamics, it effectively hard-codes a truncated  fractional derivative in the network architecture. The GL approximation  has limited accuracy unless a large number of terms are used (which  increases computation). Moreover, it does not address the fundamental  chain rule problem so much as sidestep it by using a definition that is  inherently discrete and local in an extended state space (each  fractional difference uses previous neuron states). Compared to the  spectral method in our document, the GL approach can be seen as *time-domain and approximate*, whereas the spectral method is *frequency-domain and exact (up to numerical precision)* for the given discretisation. The spectral method handles the entire  history via FFT without truncation, whereas GL or finite difference  methods usually apply a short-memory principle (ignoring contributions  beyond a window) to remain computationally feasible[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=There are many ways to,methods need truncation of the). Thus, the spectral method may achieve higher accuracy for the same  computational cost if the signal length is large and the fractional  memory is truly long.

**Analytical Chain Rule Formulas:** Another approach, as referenced earlier, is to derive an analytical  expression for the fractional chain rule and implement it. Recent  research by Candan and Çubukçu (2024) tackled this by employing the Faà  di Bruno formula for Caputo fractional derivatives to explicitly compute fractional gradients in a neural network[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378804452_Implementation_of_Caputo_type_fractional_derivative_chain_rule_on_back_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Fractional gradient computation is a,for the use of any). Their method effectively expands the fractional derivative of composite functions into a (potentially infinite) series and then determines how  to truncate or bound it so that it can be computed for backpropagation.  The advantage of an analytic series approach is that it stays in the  time-domain and could be directly integrated into autograd frameworks  without using FFT, at least for scalar or low-dimensional problems.  However, the complexity of evaluating those series for each training  example might be prohibitive – indeed, Faà di Bruno formula even for  integer high-order derivatives becomes extremely complicated. The  spectral method in the document contrasts with this by avoiding series  altogether; it leverages a transform to inherently account for *all orders* of interaction in one go (the infinite series of the chain rule is  effectively summed in closed-form by the $(i\omega)^\alpha$ factor).  Therefore, the spectral method is likely more efficient and easier to  implement than general Faà di Bruno expansions. The trade-off is that  the spectral method operates in the *linear* regime (it covers linear fractional ops exactly), whereas the Faà di  Bruno approach could potentially handle fractional derivatives of  nonlinear composite functions more directly. In practice, neural  networks have many nonlinear activations, but one usually only needs the fractional derivative for specific layers or terms (e.g. a fractional  differential equation being solved inside the network, or a fractional  regularisation term). For those, it is often sufficient to handle the  fractional part linearly and use normal chain rule for the rest – which  is exactly what the spectral method facilitates.

**Adjoint Equations in Fractional PDEs:** In the field of fractional partial differential equations and optimal control, researchers derive *adjoint equations* to compute gradients of objectives with respect to inputs or  parameters. This is analogous to backpropagation but in continuous time. There are works on fractional optimal control where the adjoint of a  Caputo or RL fractional operator is derived (often it ends up being a  fractional integral operator of the same order). For example, one might  see in some studies that the optimality system for a fractional  diffusion equation includes a fractional adjoint diffusion equation  (running backward in time). Those approaches are essentially doing  manually what the spectral autograd does automatically. The spectral  approach can be seen as a way to *automate* the process of deriving and solving the adjoint equations by converting to the frequency domain – a strategy that is in line with spectral  collocation and spectral Galerkin methods known in numerical analysis.  In comparison, solving adjoint equations in time domain often requires  similar cost as the forward solve (so if the forward is $O(n^2)$, so is  the adjoint). The spectral autograd collapses that overhead by solving  the adjoint in the spectral domain ($O(n\log n)$). This is a significant improvement, and it echoes the benefit seen in, say, using FFT-based  solvers for convolutional optimal control problems.

**Fractional Gradient Descent vs Fractional Backpropagation:** It is worth noting a distinction in literature: some papers discuss *fractional order gradient descent* algorithms (using fractional calculus in the parameter update rule, e.g. using memory in gradients)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314253535_Fractional-order_gradient_descent_learning_of_BP_neural_networks_with_Caputo_derivative#:~:text=Fractional,particular%2C the conformable fractional), which is different from what we discuss here (which is differentiating  through a model that itself has fractional dynamics). The document’s  focus is on the latter – making sure we can compute $\partial  \text{loss}/\partial x$ when $x$ is subject to a fractional derivative.  Alternative treatments in this area are sparse. One known work is by  Zhuang et al. (2019) who proposed using a fractional order  backpropagation for training, but their notion was to use a fractional  power of the gradient in the weight update, not in computing the  gradient through a fractional network component. Thus, the *problem* addressed by the document – how to backpropagate *through* a fractional operator – has not been widely addressed before, making  direct comparisons few. This underscores the novelty of the spectral  framework.

**Software and Practical Implementations:** There are some tools for fractional calculus in computing, like the Python `fracdiff` library for fractional differencing in time series. These typically use either FFT or FIR filter approximations to apply a fractional  difference. In fact, using FFT convolution to apply a fractional  differintegrator is a known technique in signal processing[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=Namely%2C the Laplace transform of,controller can be realized by). What the document does is incorporate that into autograd. One could  achieve a similar result by manually coding a custom PyTorch layer that  does an FFT-based fractional filter and uses `torch.autograd.Function` to define the gradient via inverse FFT with conjugate multiplication.  To our knowledge, there isn’t yet a widely used deep learning library  module that does fractional differentiation out-of-the-box. The approach in the document could fill that gap. Alternatives would either  approximate the fractional derivative by a finite impulse response  (which is essentially what `fracdiff` does for time series – it truncates the fractional difference impulse  response to a certain length and applies it as a filter). That approach  is straightforward but introduces approximation error and still has to  manage gradient computation (though once it’s a finite impulse response  convolution, autograd can handle it as a 1-D convolution layer). The  spectral method, in contrast, captures the *entire impulse response* in one transform (no truncation) and thus can be more accurate for  long-range dependencies, at the cost of a transform operation.

**Accuracy and Error Comparison:** One should highlight that spectral methods are often **spectrally accurate** for smooth signals (meaning the error decays faster than any polynomial in $n$ if the function is smooth), whereas finite difference methods  for fractional derivatives are typically of a certain convergence order  (say $O(h^{\beta})$ for some $\beta$ depending on the scheme). If the  function $f(x)$ is sufficiently smooth or well-behaved, the FFT approach can be extremely accurate (limited mainly by machine precision and the  handling of aliasing). If $f(x)$ has discontinuities or singular  behaviour, then both spectral and time-domain methods face challenges  (spectral might suffer Gibbs oscillations, time-domain might need very  fine resolution near singularities). The document’s suggestion of using  Mellin for multiplicative behaviour is in line with handling power-law  singularities better. Traditional approaches might just refine the time  grid near problematic points, which can be inefficient.

**Summary of Comparisons:** In summary, the spectral autograd framework compares favourably to alternative approaches:

-   *Versus naive autograd (treating fractional op as a black-box):* The spectral method is exponentially more efficient. Standard autograd  would either fail or take $O(n^2)$ with enormous memory use, which is impractical for meaningful $n$.
-   *Versus discrete approximation (e.g. GL, FIR filters):* The spectral method is more exact and can leverage fast transforms.  Discrete approximations can be used with standard conv layers, but to  get high accuracy for long memory they become costly or need special  care. The spectral method handles long memory naturally.
-   *Versus analytic fractional chain rules (series expansions):* The spectral method is computationally simpler and avoids dealing with  infinite series. Analytic methods might provide insight (and could  complement understanding of regularity), but for implementation, the  spectral approach is far more straightforward and scalable. The  literature (such as Candan & Çubukçu) confirms that solving the  fractional chain rule analytically is possible but complex[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378804452_Implementation_of_Caputo_type_fractional_derivative_chain_rule_on_back_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Fractional gradient computation is a,for the use of any), whereas the spectral method essentially “solves” the chain rule by converting it to a product in frequency space.
-   *Versus adjoint PDE derivation:* The spectral method automates what one would manually derive and solve  as adjoint equations, and does it efficiently. It thus can be seen as  bringing techniques from spectral numerical methods into the machine  learning/autodiff realm, which is innovative.

No approach is without drawbacks: the spectral method requires global operations (FFT) which can be  problematic on distributed systems or for very large data that doesn’t  fit in memory. Time-domain local methods (like finite differences) can  sometimes be more memory-local (streaming). However, one can also  implement FFT in streaming or chunked modes as noted. Another possible  issue is that spectral methods typically assume the input data length is known and fixed, whereas some neural architectures (like certain RNNs)  might process variable-length sequences. Adapting the FFT approach to  variable lengths is doable (zero-pad to next power of 2, for example)  but might need extra handling. Still, these are engineering issues;  fundamentally, the spectral method stands out as a rigorous and  efficient solution to fractional backpropagation.

**Current State of the Art:** The document’s framework appears to be at the cutting edge, given that  not many works have addressed fractional autograd head-on. It builds  upon known mathematical principles and demonstrates them in an autograd  context. The inclusion of references in the original text suggests  awareness of related work: for instance, the citation of the 2018  fractional backpropagation conference paper and the 2024 chain rule  paper shows the authors are positioning their work relative to those.  This evaluation confirms that the spectral approach is both novel and  well-grounded in theory. It provides a compelling alternative to other  methods by leveraging the *strengths of spectral analysis (exact convolution handling and fast transforms)* in contrast to *time-domain approximations or complex series formulas*.

## **Concluding Remarks**

The *“Mathematical Treatment of Backpropagation Through Non-Local Fractional Operators”* presents a comprehensive framework that is mathematically sound and  addresses the core difficulties of fractional autograd. We verified  that:

-   The use of fractional calculus  definitions (RL derivative) is correct, and the challenges of  non-locality and chain rule are real issues that the framework  appropriately acknowledges. The proposed fractional chain rule series is formally insightful, though practical implementation relies on the  spectral method rather than directly summing that series.
-   The spectral domain solution is  valid: fractional differentiation becomes a multiplication by  $(i\omega)^\alpha$ (or $s^\alpha$), which we confirmed with known  transform properties[sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn](https://sites.gc.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/10/pdf-55.pdf#:~:text=Namely%2C the Laplace transform of,controller can be realized by). The adjoint (backward) operator corresponds to multiplying by the conjugate symbol, which the algorithm implements correctly. This conversion of a non-local problem into a local spectral one is the crux of the method, and it stands on firm theoretical ground.
-   The computational complexity advantage ($O(n\log n)$ vs $O(n^2)$) is well justified, and the memory usage is drastically reduced. The document anticipated  numerical stability issues like spectral leakage and branch cut  handling, offering remedies like regularisation and adaptive transform  choices. This indicates a thorough understanding of practical concerns beyond formal mathematics.
-   The forward and backward  algorithms are structured in a way that is consistent with autodiff  frameworks. They correctly perform transforms, multiplications, and  inverse transforms to propagate values and gradients. We identified only minor pseudocode oversights (like using IFFT for Mellin in text) which  do not detract from the overall correctness of the approach. In an  actual implementation, careful selection of transform (FFT vs others)  would be made based on context, as suggested.
-   Compared to alternative  approaches, the spectral framework is highly competitive. It provides an exact (up to machine precision) method to handle fractional operators  in training, unlike some methods that rely on truncation or  approximation[itm-conferences.org](https://www.itm-conferences.org/articles/itmconf/pdf/2018/06/itmconf_cst2018_00004.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,and the mechanism of smooth). It bypasses the combinatorial complexity of direct chain rule expansions by leveraging transform-domain simplification[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378804452_Implementation_of_Caputo_type_fractional_derivative_chain_rule_on_back_propagation_algorithm#:~:text=Fractional gradient computation is a,for the use of any). In essence, it brings established techniques from fractional signal  processing into the realm of automatic differentiation, thereby opening  new possibilities for incorporating fractional dynamics into machine  learning models efficiently.

In conclusion, the mathematical foundations of the framework are **robust and rigorous**. By combining fractional calculus with spectral analysis, the document  creates a viable path to integrate non-local fractional operators into  modern autodiff systems. Our critique finds the approach to be both **theoretically sound** and **practically promising**, with the necessary awareness of potential pitfalls and how to mitigate  them. Future work may involve implementing this framework in a deep  learning library and testing it on real-world problems (e.g.  fractional-order neural networks or physics-informed learning involving  fractional PDEs). The comparisons suggest that this spectral method  could outperform existing fractional backpropagation techniques in both  accuracy and efficiency, marking a significant step forward in the  field.
