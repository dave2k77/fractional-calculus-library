## Conclusion

The hpfracc library demonstrates strong test coverage in core mathematical functionality (80%+) but has critical gaps in machine learning components (20-40% coverage). The 56% overall coverage provides a solid foundation, but significant investment in ML and GPU testing is needed to ensure production reliability.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Implement comprehensive ML module testing
2. Add GPU-specific test suites
3. Create integration test workflows
4. Establish performance regression testing

**Expected Impact:** Achieving 80%+ coverage across all modules would increase overall library coverage to approximately 75-80%, significantly improving reliability and maintainability.
