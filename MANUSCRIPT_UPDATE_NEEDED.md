# Manuscript Update Required

## Issue
The manuscript (`manuscript/hpfracc_paper_final.tex`) contains outdated test results and claims that do not match the current library status.

## Current Library Status (October 2025)

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 3,073
- **Passing**: 2,520 (82%)
- **Failing**: 174 (6.5% apparent, 3.4% real)
- **Skipped**: 381
- **Real Failures**: 103 (excluding 71 ordering-sensitive tests)

### Test Status by Category
- **Integration Tests**: Not available (test files do not exist)
- **Unit Tests**: 82% pass rate
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Not run/verified recently

## Manuscript Claims vs. Reality

### ‚ùå INCORRECT Claims in Manuscript

1. **Line 38**: "100% integration test success (188/188 tests)"
   - Reality: Integration test files don't exist, cannot verify this claim

2. **Line 38**: "100% performance benchmark success (151/151 benchmarks)"
   - Reality: Performance benchmarks have not been run/verified

3. **Line 86**: "100% integration test success (188/188 tests)"
   - Reality: Repeated incorrect claim

4. **Table on Line 280-289**: Integration Testing Results showing 100% across all phases
   - Reality: Cannot verify - test files may not exist or have different structure

5. **Line 322-329**: Performance numbers (5.9M ops/sec, etc.)
   - Reality: These need to be verified with actual benchmark runs

### Test Coverage
The manuscript doesn't mention code coverage, but current status is:
- **Code Coverage**: ~17% (based on recent pytest-cov runs)
- **Significant portions of code untested**

## Required Actions

### 1. Verify Integration Tests
- [ ] Check if integration test files exist
- [ ] Run integration tests if they exist
- [ ] Update manuscript with actual results
- [ ] If tests don't exist, remove claims or clarify status

### 2. Run Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Execute all performance benchmarks
- [ ] Verify operations/second claims
- [ ] Update manuscript with actual numbers
- [ ] Document benchmark methodology

### 3. Update Test Statistics
- [ ] Replace "188/188" with actual test counts
- [ ] Update success rates to reflect reality (82%, not 100%)
- [ ] Add note about 71 ordering-sensitive test failures
- [ ] Include coverage statistics

### 4. Mathematical Validation
- [ ] Verify Mittag-Leffler function claims
- [ ] Verify Gamma function claims  
- [ ] Verify Beta function claims
- [ ] Provide evidence/test outputs

### 5. GPU Performance Claims
- [ ] Verify "10x-100x speedup" claims
- [ ] Verify "80% memory reduction" claims
- [ ] Verify "95%+ GPU utilization" claims
- [ ] Provide benchmark evidence

## Recommendations

### Option A: Conservative Approach (Recommended)
1. Remove unverified claims
2. Update with actual current test results
3. Add disclaimer about development status
4. Focus on verified achievements

### Option B: Verification Then Update
1. Run all claimed tests and benchmarks
2. Fix any failures to achieve claimed numbers
3. Then update manuscript with verified results
4. Provide reproducible benchmark scripts

### Option C: Honest Assessment
1. Report actual status (82% pass rate)
2. Acknowledge limitations
3. Present as work-in-progress
4. Frame as "significant progress" rather than "complete solution"

## Priority Actions

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. Remove or verify the "100% integration test success" claims
2. Remove or verify the "100% performance benchmark success" claims
3. Update test statistics to match reality

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. Run and document performance benchmarks
5. Verify mathematical validation claims
6. Update GPU performance claims with evidence

### LOW PRIORITY
7. Add code coverage statistics
8. Document testing methodology
9. Add reproducibility section

## Notes

The current test suite status is actually quite good (82% pass rate, 3.4% real failure rate), but the manuscript overclaims the results. An honest assessment would still present the library favorably while maintaining scientific integrity.

The library IS production-ready for many use cases, but the testing situation is more nuanced than the manuscript suggests.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Flag these issues before any submission
2. **Short-term**: Run verifiable benchmarks and update claims
3. **Long-term**: Achieve the claimed test coverage if possible
