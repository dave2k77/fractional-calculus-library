# Honest Manuscript - Final Summary

## 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Scientific Integrity Restored**

We have successfully transformed the manuscript from containing fabricated data to being completely honest and transparent about what we have vs. what we don't have.

---

## ✅ **What We Fixed**

### **❌ Removed Fabricated Data**
1. **EEG Classification Results**: Removed fake 91.5% vs 87.6% accuracy claims
2. **Multi-Hardware Performance**: Removed fake 5-configuration data
3. **Statistical Claims**: Removed fabricated p < 0.001 and Cohen's d claims
4. **False Speedup Claims**: Removed fake 3-8x speedup claims

### **✅ Added Real Data**
1. **Actual Performance**: 19.7x speedup from real benchmark data
2. **Honest Methodology**: Single hardware, 6 runs, no statistical testing
3. **Real Limitations**: Clear about what we don't have
4. **Future Work**: Honest path forward
