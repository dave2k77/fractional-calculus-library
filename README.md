A high-performance Python library for numerical methods in fractional calculus, featuring a novel **Fractional Autograd Framework**, dramatic speedups, and production-ready optimizations across all methods.

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### Installation
```bash
pip install hpfracc
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import hpfracc as hpc
import torch

# Create time array
t = torch.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
x = torch.sin(t)

# Compute fractional derivative with autograd support
alpha = 0.5  # fractional order
result = hpc.fractional_derivative(x, alpha, method="caputo")
# result.requires_grad = True for automatic differentiation
```
