## 🚀 What's Working Now

### Automatic Benefits (Zero Code Changes)

Your existing code automatically gets:

1. **Smart backend selection**
   - Small data → NumPy (fast)
   - Large data → GPU (parallel)
   - Gradients → PyTorch (autograd)
   - Math ops → JAX (optimized)

2. **Memory safety**
   - Dynamic GPU thresholds
   - Prevents OOM errors
   - Automatic CPU fallback

3. **Performance learning**
   - Tracks what works best
   - Adapts over time
   - Gets smarter with use

### Example Usage

```python
# Option 1: Automatic (zero changes)
from hpfracc.ml.layers import FractionalLayer
layer = FractionalLayer(alpha=0.5)  # Uses intelligent selection

# Option 2: Explicit control
from hpfracc.ml.intelligent_backend_selector import select_optimal_backend
backend = select_optimal_backend("matmul", data.shape)

# Option 3: Advanced (with learning)
from hpfracc.ml.intelligent_backend_selector import IntelligentBackendSelector
selector = IntelligentBackendSelector(enable_learning=True)
backend = selector.select_backend(workload)
```
