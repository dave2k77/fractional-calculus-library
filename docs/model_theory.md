## Introduction to Fractional Calculus

### What is Fractional Calculus?

Fractional calculus extends the classical calculus of integer-order derivatives and integrals to non-integer orders. While traditional calculus deals with derivatives of order 1, 2, 3, etc., fractional calculus allows us to compute derivatives of order 0.5, 1.7, or any real number α.

### Historical Context

The concept of fractional derivatives dates back to the 17th century, with contributions from mathematicians like Leibniz, Euler, and Riemann. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that fractional calculus found practical applications in physics, engineering, and more recently, machine learning.

### Why Fractional Derivatives in ML?

Fractional derivatives offer several advantages in machine learning:

1. **Memory Effects**: They can capture long-range dependencies and memory effects in data
2. **Smoothness Control**: They provide fine-grained control over the smoothness of functions
3. **Non-local Behavior**: Unlike integer derivatives, they are non-local operators
4. **Physical Interpretability**: They often have clear physical meanings in various domains

## Mathematical Foundations

### Riemann-Liouville Definition

The Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order α for a function f(t) is defined as:

```
D^α f(t) = (1/Γ(n-α)) * d^n/dt^n ∫[0,t] (t-τ)^(n-α-1) f(τ) dτ
```

where:
- n = ⌈α⌉ (smallest integer greater than or equal to α)
- Γ(x) is the gamma function
- 0 < α < n

**Properties:**
- **Linearity**: D^α(af + bg) = aD^αf + bD^αg
- **Composition**: D^α(D^βf) = D^(α+β)f (under certain conditions)
- **Memory**: The derivative at time t depends on the entire history from 0 to t

### Caputo Definition

The Caputo fractional derivative is defined as:

```
D^α f(t) = (1/Γ(n-α)) * ∫[0,t] (t-τ)^(n-α-1) f^(n)(τ) dτ
```

where f^(n)(τ) is the nth derivative of f.

**Advantages over Riemann-Liouville:**
- Better behavior with initial conditions
- More suitable for differential equations
- Easier to handle in numerical methods

**Limitation:**
- Only defined for 0 < α < 1 in our implementation

### Grünwald-Letnikov Definition

The Grünwald-Letnikov definition provides a numerical approximation:

```
D^α f(t) = lim(h→0) h^(-α) * Σ[k=0 to N] w_k^(α) * f(t - kh)
```

where:
- h is the step size
- N = t/h
- w_k^(α) are the Grünwald-Letnikov weights

**Advantages:**
- Direct numerical implementation
- Good for discrete data
- Stable for a wide range of α

### Weyl, Marchaud, and Hadamard Definitions

#### Weyl Fractional Derivative
Suitable for periodic functions defined on the real line:

```
D^α f(t) = (1/2π) * ∫[-∞,∞] (iω)^α * F(ω) * e^(iωt) dω
```

where F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t).

#### Marchaud Fractional Derivative
Defined for functions with specific decay properties:

```
D^α f(t) = (α/Γ(1-α)) * ∫[0,∞] (f(t) - f(t-τ)) / τ^(α+1) dτ
```

#### Hadamard Fractional Derivative
Logarithmic fractional derivative:

```
D^α f(t) = (1/Γ(1-α)) * d/dt ∫[1,t] (ln(t/τ))^(-α) * f(τ) / τ dτ
```

## Neural Network Integration

### Fractional Neural Networks

#### Architecture

A fractional neural network applies fractional derivatives to inputs and intermediate activations:

```
Input → Fractional Derivative → Linear Layer → Activation → Fractional Derivative → Linear Layer → Output
```

#### Mathematical Formulation

For a layer with input x and weights W, the output is:

```
y = σ(D^α(Wx + b))
```

where:
- D^α is the fractional derivative of order α
- σ is the activation function
- W and b are the weight matrix and bias vector

#### Benefits in Neural Networks

1. **Enhanced Feature Extraction**: Fractional derivatives can capture more complex patterns
2. **Regularization Effect**: They act as a form of regularization
3. **Memory Capacity**: They can encode long-range dependencies
4. **Smoothness Control**: They provide control over function smoothness

### Fractional Layers

#### Convolutional Layers

For 1D convolution with fractional derivatives:

```
y[i] = Σ[j] D^α(x[i-j]) * k[j]
```

where k[j] are the convolution kernel weights.

#### Recurrent Layers

For LSTM with fractional derivatives:

```
f_t = σ(D^α(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f))
i_t = σ(D^α(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i))
C̃_t = tanh(D^α(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C))
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t
o_t = σ(D^α(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o))
h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)
```

#### Transformer Layers

For attention mechanisms with fractional derivatives:

```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(D^α(QK^T)/√d_k)V
```

## Adjoint Method Optimization

### Mathematical Background

The adjoint method is a technique for efficiently computing gradients in optimization problems. For a function f(x) where x depends on parameters θ, we want to compute:

```
∂f/∂θ = (∂f/∂x) * (∂x/∂θ)
```

The adjoint method computes this efficiently by solving an adjoint equation.

### Implementation in HPFRACC

#### Memory-Efficient Forward Pass

```python
def forward_with_checkpointing(self, x, start_layer, end_layer):
    """
    Forward pass with gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
    
    This trades computation for memory by recomputing intermediate
    activations during the backward pass.
    """
    for i in range(start_layer, end_layer):
        x = self.layers[i](x)
        
        if self.activation == "relu":
            x = F.relu(x)
        elif self.activation == "tanh":
            x = torch.tanh(x)
        
        # Apply dropout (except for last layer)
        if i < len(self.layers) - 2:
            x = self.dropout_layer(x)
    
    return x
```

#### Gradient Accumulation

```python
def accumulate_gradients(self, loss, accumulation_steps):
    """
    Accumulate gradients over multiple forward-backward passes
    
    This allows training with larger effective batch sizes
    while maintaining memory efficiency.
    """
    # Scale loss by accumulation steps
    scaled_loss = loss / accumulation_steps
    scaled_loss.backward()
    
    # Accumulate gradients
    if (self.step + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        self.optimizer.step()
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    self.step += 1
```

### Performance Benefits

#### Memory Reduction

The adjoint method reduces memory usage through:

1. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Recomputes intermediate activations
2. **Selective Storage**: Only stores necessary tensors
3. **Efficient Backpropagation**: Optimizes the backward pass

#### Computational Efficiency

1. **Reduced Memory Transfers**: Less data movement between CPU/GPU
2. **Better Cache Utilization**: More efficient use of memory hierarchy
3. **Parallelization**: Better parallel execution patterns

## Graph Neural Networks with Fractional Calculus

### Theoretical Foundation

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend the concept of neural networks to graph-structured data, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. The integration of fractional calculus in GNNs introduces memory effects and long-range dependencies that are particularly valuable for graph learning tasks.

#### Mathematical Formulation

For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with node features $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and adjacency matrix $A$, the fractional graph convolution can be expressed as:

$$H^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(D^{-\frac{1}{2}} \tilde{A} D^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{(l)} W^{(l)} + \mathcal{D}^{\alpha} H^{(l)}\right)$$

Where:
- $H^{(l)}$ is the node representation at layer $l$
- $\mathcal{D}^{\alpha}$ is the fractional derivative operator of order $\alpha$
- $\tilde{A} = A + I$ is the augmented adjacency matrix
- $D$ is the degree matrix
- $W^{(l)}$ are learnable parameters

#### Fractional Graph Convolution

The fractional graph convolution combines traditional graph convolution with fractional derivatives:

$$\text{FracGCN}(X, A) = \text{GCN}(X, A) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{D}^{\alpha} X$$

This formulation allows the network to:
- Capture local graph structure through standard convolution
- Model long-range dependencies through fractional derivatives
- Adapt the influence of fractional terms through learnable parameter $\lambda$

#### Multi-Head Attention in Graphs

For Graph Attention Networks (GAT), fractional calculus enhances the attention mechanism:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}(a^T[Wx_i \| Wx_j] + \mathcal{D}^{\alpha} x_i)\right)}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}(a^T[Wx_i \| Wx_k] + \mathcal{D}^{\alpha} x_i)\right)}$$

The fractional derivative term $\mathcal{D}^{\alpha} x_i$ provides additional context for attention computation, enabling more informed node-to-node attention weights.

### Architectural Variants

#### 1. Fractional Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

The FractionalGCN applies fractional derivatives at each layer:

```python
class FractionalGCN:
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # Standard graph convolution
        conv_out = self.graph_conv(x, edge_index)
        
        # Fractional derivative contribution
        frac_out = self.fractional_derivative(x)
        
        # Combine both contributions
        return conv_out + self.lambda_param * frac_out
```

#### 2. Fractional Graph Attention Network (GAT)

FractionalGAT enhances attention with fractional calculus:

```python
class FractionalGAT:
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # Compute attention scores with fractional context
        attention_scores = self.compute_attention(x, edge_index)
        
        # Apply fractional attention
        attended_features = self.apply_attention(x, attention_scores)
        
        # Add fractional derivative contribution
        frac_contribution = self.fractional_derivative(x)
        
        return attended_features + self.lambda_param * frac_contribution
```

#### 3. Fractional Graph U-Net

The FractionalGraphUNet uses hierarchical pooling with fractional calculus:

```python
class FractionalGraphUNet:
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # Encoder path with fractional derivatives
        encoder_outputs = []
        current_x = x
        
        for layer in self.encoder_layers:
            current_x = layer(current_x, edge_index)
            encoder_outputs.append(current_x)
        
        # Decoder path with skip connections
        for i, layer in enumerate(self.decoder_layers):
            skip_x = encoder_outputs[-(i + 2)]
            current_x = self.combine_features(current_x, skip_x)
            current_x = layer(current_x, edge_index)
        
        return current_x
```

### Backend Implementation

        gradients = torch.gradient(x, dim=-1)[0]
        return self.preserve_shape(gradients, x.shape)

        # Fractional derivative approximation
        return x * (alpha ** 0.5)
```

    if alpha == 0:
        return x
    elif alpha == 1:
        # JAX-compatible first derivative
        diff = jnp.diff(x, axis=-1)
        return self.preserve_shape(diff, x.shape)

        return x * (alpha ** 0.5)
```

        diff = np.diff(x, axis=-1)
        return self.preserve_shape(diff, x.shape)
    else:
        return x * (alpha ** 0.5)
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Efficiency

Fractional GNNs maintain memory efficiency through:
- **Selective Fractional Application**: Only apply fractional derivatives where beneficial
- **Parameter Sharing**: Share fractional derivative parameters across layers
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory during backpropagation

#### Computational Complexity

The computational complexity is:
- **Standard GCN**: $O(|E| \cdot d^2)$
- **Fractional GCN**: $O(|E| \cdot d^2 + |V| \cdot d \cdot \log d)$

The additional cost comes from fractional derivative computation, which is typically $O(d \log d)$ using FFT-based methods.

#### Convergence Properties

Fractional GNNs exhibit improved convergence due to:
- **Long-range Information**: Fractional derivatives capture distant node relationships
- **Smoothing Effects**: Fractional operators provide regularization
- **Stable Gradients**: Better gradient flow through the network
